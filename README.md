# Odoo Uruguayan Localization

This repository hosts the official Uruguayan localization provided by OCA. It extends ODOO/OpenERP functionalities to be usable in Uruguay.

It also hosts temporarily the modules for the Government Resource Planning solution developed by the Government of Uruguay. Those modules will be spread later in more specific repositories (vertical-government for example).

This part will be replaced when running the oca-gen-addons-table script from OCA/maintainer-tools.
